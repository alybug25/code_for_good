Green Grocer is a website that helps users make environmentally conscious food shopping choices by providing alternatives. Each alternative includes its average price and CO2 emissions, encouraging users to balance sustainability with cost. The aim of our project was to show people that, although eco-friendly options can sometimes be more expensive, making small but consistent changes and being mindful about what you choose to buy can make a difference!

This project was a team effort - Anna, Isabel, Amelia, and I - submitted as part of the AdaHack 2025 hackathon under the 'Coding for Good' challenge, wherein participants had to create a solution that raised awareness on a social issue. It was very challenging to come up with and build an idea in 12 hours so please note that it may not work perfectly in the future. Despite this, we're proud of what we achieved in the limited time we had and learned a lot of valuable skills from the experience :)
